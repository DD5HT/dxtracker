# dxtracker

A simple Rust Telnet Client, which connects to an DX Cluster Server. It also adds filter functionality to get specific calls.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DD5HT/dxtracker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DD5HT/dxtracker)

## Disclaimer
I also use this project to experiment with git/ github TDD and Travis CI so chances are that it breaks.
A stable release is planned for the future.

The code only runs on nightly at the moment, but it could easily ported to a stable release.
